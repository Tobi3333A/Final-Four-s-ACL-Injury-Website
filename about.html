                <h2><strong>Wear It, Don't Tear It!</strong></h2>
                <p>
                Hello! We are <i></i> Kiersten Robinson, Oluwatobiloba Adejumo, Nick Warner, and Sidik Dagnogo; we are all engineering majors from Xavier University of Louisiana.<br><br>
                Recognizing the alarming rise in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries among youth and child athletes, we set out to explore ways to mitigate this growing concern. Athletics plays a vital 
                role not only in physical development but also in fostering teamwork, discipline, and community engagement. For this reason, we believe that protecting athletes from preventable injuries is both a scientific and social responsibility.<br><br>
                Our research focuses on developing a predictive model capable of estimating an athlete’s likelihood of sustaining an ACL injury. Beyond prediction, we aim to provide personalized guidance, both automated and through certified health 
                professionals, to help users make informed decisions about training and recovery.<br><br>
                Additionally, we envision a collaborative athlete network, where users can share experiences, exchange advice, and build a supportive community centered on injury prevention and performance improvement. This integration of technology, 
                health science, and social connection embodies our goal: to make sports safer, smarter, and more sustainable for athletes at every level.<br>
                </p>
                <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>An <a href="http://10.253.208.232:8501" target="_blank">ACL Risk Checker</a> that evaluates how likely a person is to get an ACL injury</li>
                    <li>A platform to conenct with other athletes around the U.S.</li>
                    <li>Custom advice for you to help reduce ACL risk</li>
                    <li>Connection to health professionals for people with high ACL risks</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Where This is Going</h2>
                <p>This is just the beginning.<br>
                Later, a more accurate predictor will be made using real-time datasets from sensors and reports from questionnaires that would be passed through to Xavier University's athletes.<br>
                There will also be tools and apps for other injuries.<br>
