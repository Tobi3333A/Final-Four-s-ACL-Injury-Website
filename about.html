                <h2><strong>Built To Last All Four Quarters!</strong></h2>
                <p>
                Hello! We are <i></i> Kiersten Robinson, Oluwatobiloba Adejumo, Nick Warner, and Sidik Dagnogo; we are all engineering majors from Xavier University of Louisiana.<br><br>
                Recognizing the alarming rise in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries among youth and child athletes, we set out to explore ways to mitigate this growing concern. Athletics plays a vital 
                role not only in physical development but also in fostering teamwork, discipline, and community engagement. For this reason, we believe that protecting athletes from preventable injuries is both a scientific and social responsibility.<br><br>
                Our research focuses on developing a predictive model capable of estimating an athlete’s likelihood of sustaining an ACL injury. Beyond prediction, we aim to provide personalized guidance, both automated and through certified health 
                professionals, to help users make informed decisions about training and recovery.<br><br>
                Additionally, we envision a collaborative athlete network, where users can share experiences, exchange advice, and build a supportive community centered on injury prevention and performance improvement. This integration of technology, 
                health science, and social connection embodies our goal: to make sports safer, smarter, and more sustainable for athletes at every level.<br>
                </p>
                <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>An <a href="http://10.253.208.232:8501" target="_blank">ACL Risk Checker</a> that evaluates an individual’s likelihood of sustaining an ACL injury.</li>
                    <li>A nationwide athlete networking platform that enables users to connect and engage with peers across the United States.</li>
                    <li>Personalized recommendations designed to help users lower their ACL injury risk.</li>
                    <li>Direct access to health professionals for individuals identified as having elevated ACL injury risks.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Where This is Going</h2>
                <p>This marks only the beginning of our initiative.<br>
                In the future, we plan to develop a more advanced predictive model that leverages real-time datasets for greater accuracy. We will also get data from athletes at Xavier University of Louisiana.<br>
                Additionally, we aim to introduce interactive tools and applications designed to educate users on preventing other related injuries.<br>
