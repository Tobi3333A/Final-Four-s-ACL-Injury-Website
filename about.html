                <h2><strong>Athletics for All. Safety for the Athletes.</strong></h2>
                <p>
                Hello! We are <i></i>: Oluwatobiloba Adejumo, Sidik Dagnogo, Kiersten Robinson, and Nick Warner, engineering majors from Xavier Universuty of Louisiana.<br>
                We noticed the rising rate in ACL injuries among youth athletes and even children, so we thought of what we could do to alleviate this condition, as atletics 
                is an important part of life not just for the players, but also for the fans.<br>
                We found that the most prominent injury was the ACL injury, so we decided to create model that can predit the likeliness of an athlete to have an ACL injury.<br>
                We also felt it might be good if we give advice (automated and from a health professional) and connect athletes with each other, which won't only help atletes get advice from fellow athletes 
                but also create a community of athletes to foster better competition.<br>
                </p>
                <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>An <a href="checker.html">ACL Risk Checker</a> that evaluates how likely a person is to get an ACL injury</li>
                    <li>A platform to conenct with other athletes around the U.S.</li>
                    <li>Custom advice for you to help reduce ACL risk</li>
                    <li>Connection to health professionals for people with high ACL risks</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Why We Decided to Build This</h2>
                <p>

                </p>
                <h2>Where This is Going</h2>
                <p>This is just the beginning.<br>
                Later, a more accurate predictor using real-time datasets.<br>
                There might also be tools and apps for learning how to prevent ACL and other injuries.<br>
