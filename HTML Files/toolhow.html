        <h1>How It Works</h1>
        <h2>From Data to Prevention: How the ACL Risk Checker Keeps You Ahead</h2>
        <p>
            Our ACL Injury Risk Checker is built on a foundation of cutting-edge sports medicine research and data analysis.
            Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how the tool evaluates your personal risk and provides actionable insights:
        </p>
        <h2>Step 1: Enter Your Information</h2>
        <p>
            You’ll be asked for a few details about yourself and your training habits, such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Age, height, and weight</li>
                <li>Training hours per week</li>
                <li>Number of recovery days</li>
                <li>Average training intensity</li>
                <li>Sport or position played</li>
            </ul>
            This information is never shared publicly. It’s used only to assess your personal risk profile using a predictive model based on real athletic research.
        </p>        
        <h2>Step 2: The Predictive Model Runs the Numbers</h2>
        <p>
            The tool uses a machine learning model developed from actual sports science data and academic studies on ACL injuries.<br>
            It analyzes how different factors—like training volume, rest, and biomechanics—affect the likelihood of ACL strain or tear.<br>
            Each athlete receives a personalized ACL Risk Score, ranging from Low to Very High.<br>
            This score represents your estimated likelihood of developing an ACL injury based on patterns seen in thousands of athlete profiles.
        </p>
        <h2>Step 3: Get Personalized Insights</h2>
        <p>
            Once you receive your score, you’ll also see tailored recommendations to help reduce your risk.<br>
            For example:
            <ul>
                <li>If you train heavily but rarely rest → you’ll be advised to increase recovery time.</li>
                <li>If your intensity is high but your hamstring strength is low → you’ll get targeted strengthening suggestions.</li>
                <li>If your risk is high → you’ll be connected with a licensed healthcare professional or sports therapist for expert guidance.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Step 4: Privacy and Accuracy</h2>
        <p>
            Your data is kept secure and confidential. The model is continuously updated as more research becomes available, 
            ensuring that every athlete receives the most accurate and up-to-date guidance possible.
        </p>
        <h2>Final Message</h2>
        <p>
            Every click on this tool is a step toward protecting your athletic journey.<br>
            Whether your score is low or high, you’ll walk away with actionable insights that can make all the difference between sitting out and staying in the game.
