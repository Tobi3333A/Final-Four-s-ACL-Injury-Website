# **Final Four's ACL Injury Website**
This project is an interactive and responsive website creted to help, majorly, with the prevention of ACL injuries in Louisiana and the United States as a whole. It makes use of data from datasets and recent findings. It also encourages good relationship in the sports community.

## Features
- **Educational Blog Posts**: Includes blog posts to educate users on ACL injuries and also inlcudes tests to evaluate a user's understanding of the posts.
- **ACL Risk Assessment**: Includes an ACL risk checker made using machine learning. A user is allowed to enter their data, and the system evaluates a user's risk of getting an ACL injury based on the entered data.
- **Connection with Health Professionals**: The platform automatically suggests connecting users, with high ACL risk levels, with health professionals. This ensures that users receive professional oversight and intervention when necessary.
- **Connection with Other Users**: To promote collaboration and community among athletes in the country, a dedicated Slack channel was established. This community will allow athletes, coaches, parents of athletes, and even health professionals to exchange insights and foster a supportive environment.

## How It Works
It works just like a normal website. There are links to the ACL risk assessment checker; the blogs are shown on the homepage; there is an about page that tells you about the team; there is the Injury Tracker page (currently in development) that will allow users to create their accounts, so they can get personalized reports from an IoT device (a compression sleeve) my team designs.
## Future Improvements
My team and I are still working on this project to make it a fully functional website that incorporates readings from a **compression sleeve**, gives **personalized advice**, and performs **real-time analysis** to give users important information on the way they move their legs.
