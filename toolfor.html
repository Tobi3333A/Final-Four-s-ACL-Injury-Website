        <h1>Who Should Use This Tool?</h1>
        <h2>Empowering Athletes to Stay Strong, Smart, and Safe</h2>
        <p>
            Every athlete—no matter the sport or level—deserves to train confidently without the constant fear of injury. 
            That’s why this tool was created: to help young athletes in the U.S. understand and reduce their personal risk of ACL injury.<br>
            ACL injuries are one of the most common—and most preventable—setbacks in sports. They can end seasons, affect scholarships, and even change careers. 
            But with the right awareness and data, athletes can take control of their knee health before problems start.
